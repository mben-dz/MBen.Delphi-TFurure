Please feel free to take a look here ( it's very [Important !!](https://en.delphipraxis.net/topic/13683-introducing-my-delphi-tfuture-ppl-for-thread-safe-ui/) ):


This demo project provides a clean and safe way to perform background operations in Delphi using `TTask` and `TFuture<T>`, with a focus on keeping the **UI responsive** and preventing **memory leaks**.

## 📦 What's Inside

- `API.Helpers`: A generic async helper unit
- `Main.View`: A VCL form demonstrating good and bad usage of futures and background tasks

---

## 🔧 Helper Class: `TSimpleFuture<T>`

A simple abstraction over `TTask.Future<T>` and `TTask.Run` to make async coding easier.

```pascal
type
  TSimpleFuture<T> = class
    class procedure Run(const aQuery: TFunc<T>; const aReply: TConstProc<T>); static;
    class procedure RunFuture(const aQuery: TFunc<T>; const aReply: TConstProc<T>); static;
  end;
```

- `Run`: Runs a background task and replies to the main thread
- `RunFuture`: Uses `TFuture<T>.Value` safely from a background thread

---

## 🖼 Demo Form: `Main.View`

The form includes buttons that demonstrate the following patterns:

### ✅ Correct Usage (Non-Blocking)

#### `BtnStartWithHelper`

```pascal
TSimpleFuture<string>.RunFuture(
  function: string
  begin
    Sleep(2000);
    Result := TimeToStr(Now) + ' ✅ تم التنفيذ';
  end,
  LogReply
);
```

> ✅ Background-safe  
> ✅ Memory-safe  
> ✅ Beginner-friendly

---

### ⚠️ Incorrect Usage

#### `BtnWrongUse`

```pascal
var LFuture := TTask.Future<string>(...);
LogReply(LFuture.Value); // ❌ Blocks the main thread!
```

> ❌ This freezes the UI and defeats the purpose of async programming.

---

### ✅ Safe Manual Usage

#### `BtnWaitOutsideMainThread`

```pascal
LFuture := TTask.Future<Integer>(...);

TTask.Run(
  procedure
  begin
    var LValue := LFuture.Value;
    TThread.Queue(nil, procedure begin
      LogReply('Result: ' + LValue.ToString);
      LFuture := nil; // release `IFuture<T>` reference to avoid Memory Leak (TCompleteEventWrapper etc of internal thread pool that service the TTask).
    end);
  end);
```

> ✅ Keeps UI free  
> ✅ Releases `LFuture` to prevent leaks

---

### 🧪 Simulating `IFuture<T>` with `ITask`

#### `BtnSimulateIFuture`

```pascal
var
  LResult: string;
  LFuture := TTask.Run(...);

TTask.Run(procedure
begin
  LFuture.Wait;
  TThread.Queue(nil, procedure begin
    LogReply(LResult);
    LFuture := nil; // release `IFuture<T>` reference to avoid Memory Leak (TCompleteEventWrapper etc of internal thread pool that service the TTask).
  end);
end);
```

> 🧠 A useful trick for simulating `Future.Value` behavior without using `TFuture<T>`

---

### 🔁 Future Monitoring Pattern

#### `BtnMonitorSolution`

A more advanced way to ensure task completion:

```pascal
var LFuture := TTask.Future<string>(...);

  TTask.Run(procedure begin
    while not (LFuture.Status in
      [TTaskStatus.Completed, TTaskStatus.Canceled, TTaskStatus.Exception]) do
      TThread.Sleep(100);

    TThread.Queue(nil, procedure begin
      if LFuture.Status = TTaskStatus.Completed then
        LogReply(LFuture.Value) else
        LogReply('Future Failled or Canceled !!');
        LFuture := nil; // release `IFuture<T>` reference to avoid Memory Leak (TCompleteEventWrapper etc of internal thread pool that service the TTask).
    end);
  end);
```

---

## 🧼 Best Practices

✅ Do  
- Use `TThread.Queue` to update UI  
- Use `TFuture.Value` **only from background threads**  
- Set `LFuture := nil` to release memory  

❌ Don’t  
- Call `.Value` on the main thread  
- Forget to release `IFuture<T>` reference to avoid Memory Leak (TCompleteEventWrapper etc of internal thread pool that service the TTask). 
- Update UI directly from background threads

## 🧰 Requirements

- Delphi XE7+  
- VCL application (Windows only)  
- `System.Threading` unit

🧠 Design Philosophy: What Future Really Means  
In general software design, a Future is an abstraction that represents a promise of a result to be available in the future. It is not intended to be synchronously accessed using .Value, especially not from the main thread.  

❌ Misconception: Using .Value Is Asynchronous  
The Future is not designed for synchronous use — instead, it should be part of a fully asynchronous programming style, ideally involving a callback mechanism.  
  
Calling .Value is essentially a blocking call, which defeats the purpose of using Future in the first place.  
  
✅ The Core Idea Behind Future  
The essence of the Future abstraction is:  
  
🔹 A promise for a future result without blocking the current thread, preferably using a callback to handle the result when it’s ready.  

So using .Value is almost equivalent to Task.Wait — not a true asynchronous pattern  

⚠️ Using .Value on the Main Thread Is Misleading!  
One of the most common pitfalls developers face with IFuture<T> in Delphi is the assumption that it is meant to be accessed using .Value.  
  
In reality, this goes against the very design philosophy of Future in most programming languages.  
  
In Delphi, calling .Value internally does something like this:  
```pascal
function TFuture<T>.GetValue: T;
begin
  Wait; // ⛔ This blocks the current thread!
  Result := FResult;
end;

```
So, it's not just about when the computation starts — it’s about how you consume the result in a way that doesn't harm the user experience.  
  
  🔄 Summary  
.Value = Blocking = like Wait  
  
Future's goal = Non-blocking promise, best used with callbacks  
  
Using .Value in UI = ❌ Breaks the async model, risks freezing UI  
  
Best practice = Use background thread + TThread.Queue for result delivery  

  
## 🙌 Contributions

Feel free to open an issue or PR if you want to extend this helper for things like:
- Cancellation
- Progress reporting
- `Future.ContinueWith(...)` chaining

### 🧠 Bonus Tip

If you're a beginner, stick with `TSimpleFuture<T>.RunFuture(...)` — it's the safest way to use `TFuture` without blocking the UI.
